Cockpit Project</a></h4><p>And the last but the favorite, the Cockpit Project is an open-source web-based graphical interface for servers, intended for everyone, especially those who are new to Linux, familiar with Linux and want an easy, graphical way to administer servers, and expert admins who mainly use other tools but want an overview on individual systems. I like that this is web-based graphical user interface and it is best suitable for enterprise production servers if you want a quick grasp on what’s going with your back-end side.</p><p>It provides administrators with an intuitive and centralized platform for managing various aspects of their Linux servers, including system configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Developed primarily for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its derivatives like CentOS and Fedora, Cockpit allows users to perform administrative tasks through a web browser, thus making server management more accessible and user-friendly.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qO9kwgmTW8c5uyA19NZOAA.png" /><figcaption>Cockpit Project</figcaption></figure><p>Here is some of the reasons why you should use this as a graphical user interface for your Linux machines especially servers.</p><p><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Cockpit presents administrators with a dashboard that offers an overview of essential system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network activity. This provides a quick snapshot of the server’s health and performance.</p><p><strong>System Configuration:</strong> Users can manage various system settings and configurations through Cockpit, including network settings, user accounts, services, storage devices, and firewall rules. This centralized interface simplifies the process of configuring and maintaining Linux servers.</p><p><strong>Logs and Journal:</strong> Cockpit allows administrators to view system logs and journal entries, facilitating troubleshooting and debugging tasks. It provides tools for searching, filtering, and analyzing log data directly from the web interface.</p><p><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Cockpit includes tools for managing software updates and package installations on Linux servers. Administrators can view available updates, install packages, and perform system upgrades through the web interface.</p><p><strong>Container Management: </strong>Cockpit integrates with container technologies like Docker and Podman, allowing administrators to manage containerized applications and Docker images directly from the Cockpit dashboard.</p><p><strong>Virtual Machine Management: </strong>For servers running virtualization platforms like KVM, Cockpit provides tools for managing virtual machines (VMs), including creating, starting, stopping, and monitoring VMs.</p><p><strong>Security: </strong>Cockpit is designed with security in mind, providing authentication mechanisms to control access to server management features. Administrators can configure user accounts and permissions to restrict access to sensitive server functions.</p><blockquote>I will not be having a quick command to install this on top of your production Linux machines but please check this <a href="https://cockpit-project.org/running.html#rhel">site</a> if you want to try it yourself.</blockquote><h3>CONCLUSION</h3><p>I have specified a few examples of different kinds of Linux graphical user interface for both desktop machines, workstations, and servers. You may not like one of these interfaces according to your preferences, so please feel free to do some research on your own.</p><p>If you just want to taste each one of these flavors, sure you can try all of these. But I would suggest to just install the whole package of a Linux distro of your preferences to lessen the burden.</p><p>When it comes to production servers, I’m definitely rooting for <strong>Cockpit Project.</strong> We use on where I work at and tell you what, it is so helpful! The software options, security specs, and community support is superb.</p><p>If you have come up until this point, thank you very much for reading this article all through the end. I will be posting tons of articles regarding my projects soon and I can’t wait to share it with you. My current projects are mostly cybersecurity, hacking, and hardware related.</p><p>If you liked this, please do clap on this post, strike a comment and follow me more for. THANKS!!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=af91584fe74e" width="1" height="1" alt="">
