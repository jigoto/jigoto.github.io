NAS devices contain a processor and operating system so it can run applications and provide the intelligence needed for files to be easily shared by authorized people.</p><p>This is one of my favorite network equipment to setup and configure next to next-gen firewalls. <br>* yes, I do love firewalls and they’re amazing if done right.</p><p>Here is a short procedure that you can do when you receive your RS1221+ on your desk and having no idea what to do with it.</p><blockquote>Things that you need:</blockquote><p>Synology NAS RS1221+ <br>3.5&quot; SATA disks (I used x4 4TB disks)<br>Disk trays (3.5&quot; Type R8)<br>10Gbps PCIe 3.0 ethernet adapter (E10G21-F2)<br>Synology DDR4 memory module (optional, though I used another 8GB for mine)<br>power cable (mine was IEC320 C-13 because I had to connect to UPS)<br>CAT6 ethernet cables</p><h3>Now let’s go to the steps now.</h3><ol><li>Open up your NAS device and install your expansion cards. For my case, I added the 4TB 3.5&quot; SATA disk, 8GB memory card and 10Gbps ethernet adapter card.</li></ol><p>2. Close it back up and rack it on your server rack since this is a rackmount server.</p><p>3. When it is all racked up, plug in the LAN cables and power cable and connect to your switches. I did connect LAN 1 and LAN 2 port on each of the Cisco 3850 48P switches.</p><blockquote>NOTE: Make sure when you connect them to your network, you have DHCP enabled on that port. Or else, it will get a 169.254 address, making it inaccessible on your network.</blockquote><p>4. Go to your computer and open up a web browser and open up the Synology Web Assistant. To access that, go to the address bar of your web browser.</p><blockquote>find.synology.com or synologynas:5000 (synologynas.local:5000 for Mac computers)</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-S7S7kwV_3MYSgY6DZn6DQ.png" /></figure><p>5. You should be able to see this screen below that it has detected the NAS device on your network. Click Next.</p><p>6. After that, you will get a welcome screen. Click on ‘Start’</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vt-Ua5oxg1R26174Marcog.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PibYif9UP32NQnoQ_iK_Yw.png" /></figure><p>7. Until you see the ‘Setup’ screen which will ask you to install the DSM. Install and get your latest updates of your DSM.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IjO9oDNMuR1-8y0v-6iNOw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oRix41rSrvC67JW36jfVeQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*74CoYKa5v-iQ5hJcKklKKg.png" /></figure><p>8. After all the initialization, you will see the DSM screen. Now one last</p><p>thing I had to do on my NAS. I bind the LAN 1 and LAN 2 ports for bigger bandwidth. I clicked on the</p><blockquote>Control Panel -&gt; Network -&gt; Network Interface -&gt; Create Bond -&gt; *choose which type of bond that you want</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SJBRqv1ufg9FuKahFVa3SQ.png" /></figure><p>Easiest option is the ‘Adaptive Load Balancing’ which needs the least work and optimization. After this, it will show you something like below and will get only one IP address for both LAN ports.</p><blockquote>NOTE: This will remove of all the configurations done on those LAN ports that you set up. This includes IP addresses and other network configuration.</blockquote><p>And that’s it!! You have your working NAS now ready to get your backups, iSCSI storage systems working.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e71770987d9e" width="1" height="1" alt="">
