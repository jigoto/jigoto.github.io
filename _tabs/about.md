## Hi, my name is Jiro!
### Welcome to my tech blogsite.

Short and sweet, I will be posting some of the knowledge about how to get into the IT industry, bits of networking and cybersecurity, and probably lots of my side projects like this website.

Please support through my sites and [**Medium**](https://genkiganko.medium.com/).
Keep learning, dreamers!
